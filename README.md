# RXR Project
This github repository is to share our project codes.

- To execute the scripts in the robot's folder, it is required to install ROS packages of Tiago++ from the link below:
http://wiki.ros.org/action/info/Robots/TIAGo%2B%2B/Tutorials

- For unity folder, the pose dicrimination part is in the 'OpenPoseUserScript.cs' file. Gyro sensor data can be received by attaching the 'GyroSensor.cs' to an empty GameObject.

NOTE THAT: this only includes the minor part of our project's codes, these alone cannot run our whole project.
